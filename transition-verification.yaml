# udea is to go thru different kinds of transitions.
# * In the plane
# * Up.
# * Down
# * Into a leg with history
# * Into a orhtogoanl state
# From a state with internal states

# main should count up a counter each time it runs a tick.
# At each new value it should compare the state_full_name with predicted.
